# Node.js Mentorship Program

Myself, Surendar Vinayagamoorthy is very pasionate towards problem solving, javascript and math. To be more specific, it always motivates me to solve problems with which others are struglling. I usuall teach my friends math and physics during school and college days and this continues with JS by helping my team. I have always had a passion for teaching and watch others grow with me. Hope this platform gives me that.
